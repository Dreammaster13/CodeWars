//Batman & Robin have gotten into quite a pickle this time. The Joker has mixed up their iconic quotes and also replaced one of the characters in their names, with a number. They need help getting things back in order.

//Implement the getQuote method which takes in an array of quotes, and a string comprised of letters and a single number (e.g. "Rob1n") where the number corresponds to their quote indexed in the passed in array.

//Return the quote along with the character who said it:


const getQuote = (quotes, hero) => {
  let index = hero.match(/[0-9]+/g)
  
  if (hero.startsWith('R')) {
    return "Robin: " + quotes[index]
  } else if (hero.startsWith('J')) {
    return "Joker: " + quotes[index]
  } else {
    return "Batman: " + quotes[index]
  }
}
